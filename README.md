### So it begins.. 
So far so good, I've been having plenty of fun learning to use VS code, github and git bash.
Can't say I haven't had my fair share of anger moments when it feels like everything is good until something doesn't work and I either start all over or spend far too long trying to figure things out.
- On my free time I am trying to get better acquainted with:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - The Command line

- Today we learned about HTML template, which is exciting because I like being able to play around with different themes. See what each has to offer. After this I could help family and friends set up websites for further practice. 
- We learned what pair coding is. Then we got our assingment. With a partner, we need to practice some pair coding. I was thinking to think about what to do for it. I thought it could be interesting to have a webpage for our favourite cartoon or something silly.

Goal: Get a better understanding of UX and getting used to User Stories and Users Flows.
