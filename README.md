TODO: **Work on 404 Page Activity**
- X Find image for 404 page
- X Add 404 error text to page
- make background image take up the full screen with `height:100vh`
- How is it on mobile

Got most of the html typed out. Looking for funky image to add.  

Found an image and added text to my page. Now to find out how to put the image in the background. 

Having a really hard time getting the image to display!!

I don't know how to add this background image. I've been working on it for a while now :'(

TODO: **Work on Cards Activity**
- Figuring out what to write in the boxes that also makes sense for the website.
- X Adding text
- X Find logo or image to add to cards
- X Xadd button

Finished adding the text and finding an image for the card.

TODO: 
- X add boarders
- X play around with some colors [Used to find a nice color mix for design](https://www.designwizard.com/blog/design-trends/colour-combination)
- X add button
- X Does it work on mobile?

Have done most the items on the list. Now I have to make sure that it is usable on a mobile device. 

The website is functional and resposnsive. Navigation bar could use more work when it is in mobile mode but no sideways scroll!

TODO: **Continue working on Navigation bar**
  - X Make it so "Rob's Burger Shack" and rest of Navigation bar are on the same line.
  - X Add a background
  - X Add logo
  - X Add buttons 

- So far so good, managed to get all of the text onto one line and add a background. Now I'm just having trouble separating my list items. Trying to use `justify-content: space-evenly or space-around` but it't not doing much. 

- Was successful in adding a little burger icon!

- Finally spaced out the content that was in the middle with a "nav-wrapper." I sucks that you could spend so long trying to figure out something simple :'(. But that's the learning process.

- Okay so haven't worked on the button previously mentioned but navigation bar is looking really good. It's taken a bit but we are getting there!
- I'm finding that going along with the recording of Ashlyn coding the navigation bar is really helpful. 

***Repetition***

- I think the CSS is starting to make a lot more sense. Some of the things I'm still confused as to how they work but I'll figure it out.
- Finally made the button for a sing-up area but I had a bit of an issue that I think looks pretty cool so I think I'll keep it?

TODO: Work on Navigation bar

- For some reason I am having a hard with all the code that goes into a navigation bar. Trying to add an icon or image to navigaton bar. 

- Finished some very easy HTML so I can start playing around with some CSS

- Was able to use flexbox to display my navigation bar links in a row. It took a while becaue I was typing `class=app'to the different < div > and it wasn't doing much. But I got it eventually!

- Using the CSS-tricks website lots to help figure out what I am supposed to do. [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-properties)

TODO: 
- Make it so "Rob's Burger Shack" and rest of Navigation bar are on the same line.

- Add logo
- Add buttons

TODO: Watch yesterday's lesson

- Been working on codepen along side what Ashlyn is doing. Really like that it updates the website in real time. Enjoying it a little more than VS code, can't lie.

**After Class**

- Today I worked on a lot of html and css using codepen.
- Completely forgot that we needed a journal entry so I'll document the things that gave me the most issues.
- It was really exciting finally having that light bulb moment today as it actually made sense how html and css work together.

### Wiki Article
  - After class today I began my "Wiki Article" activity 
  - I've already submitted it but I spent a solid 3 hours or so working on it
  - It's nice to see what you are coding in real time, with codepen. 
  - I was a bit all over the place when it came to my coding, but I more or less tried to follow these steps:
    1. Set-up the skeleton of the website
    2. Then make sure everything goes in the right place. Whatever is a header is in the header section and so on with the body and footer
    3. After that I decided to play with some CSS to make the website look nice
    4. Once I got some CSS code in there, I noticed that the website was doing weird things
    5. Went back to my html and realized it was a MESS
    6. Tried to tidy it up as best as I knew how and took out things that didn't need to be there. Mostly because it was just extra code that served no purpose
    7. After that the website was pretty well centered
    8. Next I played with the background color of the website
    9. Added some fonts
    10. Once I was pretty happy with how the website looks, I tried to fix the "Contents" box so that all the numbers would line up nicely for the list. Unfortunatly I was unsuccessful in doing so
    11. The other issue I was unsuccessful with solving was the footer box. I was unable to get it to stretch from one side of the page to the other.

- I do find the visual hierarchy very interesting because with the way you design your website, you can control where people's eyes go. That mixed with the earlier classes in UX, with User Stories and User Flow. I can see how all of these could be very useful tools for a web developer. I also underestimated how much work goes into building a website such as "Apple.ca"
- I've been trying to think about the final project. There is still plenty to learn but I think that I would like to code a website for a friend of mine. She has a photography business on Instagram but would like something more professional like a website.

- Today we learned about HTML template, which is exciting because I like being able to play around with different themes. See what each has to offer. After this I could help family and friends set up websites for further practice. 
- We learned what pair coding is. Then we got our assingment. With a partner, we need to practice some pair coding. I was thinking to think about what to do for it. I thought it could be interesting to have a webpage for our favourite cartoon or something silly.

### So it begins.. 
So far so good, I've been having plenty of fun learning to use VS code, github and git bash.
Can't say I haven't had my fair share of anger moments when it feels like everything is good until something doesn't work and I either start all over or spend far too long trying to figure things out.
- On my free time I am trying to get better acquainted with:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - The Command line
