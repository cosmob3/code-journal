- I do find the visual hierarchy very interesting because with the way you design your website, you can control where people's eyes go. That mixed with the earlier classes in UX, with User Stories and User Flow. I can see how all of these could be very useful tools for a web developer. I also underestimated how much work goes into building a website such as "Apple.ca"
- I've been trying to think about the final project. There is still plenty to learn but I think that I would like to code a website for a friend of mine. She has a photography business on Instagram but would like something more professional like a website.

- Today we learned about HTML template, which is exciting because I like being able to play around with different themes. See what each has to offer. After this I could help family and friends set up websites for further practice. 
- We learned what pair coding is. Then we got our assingment. With a partner, we need to practice some pair coding. I was thinking to think about what to do for it. I thought it could be interesting to have a webpage for our favourite cartoon or something silly.

### So it begins.. 
So far so good, I've been having plenty of fun learning to use VS code, github and git bash.
Can't say I haven't had my fair share of anger moments when it feels like everything is good until something doesn't work and I either start all over or spend far too long trying to figure things out.
- On my free time I am trying to get better acquainted with:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - The Command line
