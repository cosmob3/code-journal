### So it begins.. 
So far so good, I've been having plenty of fun learning to use VS code, github and git bash.
Can't say I haven't had my fair share of anger moments when it feels like everything is good until something doesn't work and I either start all over or spend far too long trying to figure things out.

  - HTML
  - CSS
